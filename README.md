# NFT Marketplace

## Project Description

The NFT Marketplace is a decentralized smart contract platform built on Ethereum that enables users to buy, sell, and trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in a secure and transparent manner. This marketplace acts as an intermediary that facilitates peer-to-peer NFT transactions while ensuring the safety of both buyers and sellers through smart contract automation.

The platform allows NFT owners to list their digital assets for sale at fixed prices, while potential buyers can purchase these NFTs directly through the blockchain. The marketplace implements a fee structure that sustains the platform while keeping transaction costs reasonable for users.

- **Ensuring Transparent Transactions**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing complete transparency
- **Supporting Creator Economy**: Enabling artists and creators to monetize their digital works directly
